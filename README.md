An assignment for the testing section of The Odin Project's ruby curriculum.

# Tests

Small hack to run whole test suite (run on command line):

for file in test/*.rb; do ruby $file; done

Also added a rake file which can run the whole suite by typing rake in the console.

# Todo / Future updates

* Add game tests
* Add menu tests or justify why they're not needed
